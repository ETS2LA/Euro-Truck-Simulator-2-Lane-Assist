# Version 1.10.0

This version implements the new installer by @Cloud and @DylDev. We have thus finally got a .exe installer. 

# Major Changes
- New .exe installer that will replace almost all of the old .bat scripts.
	- The source code for this installer is also naturally available to download and build yourself.
- Switch to bettercam instead of the custom dxcam version.
	- Up to a 10ms performance improvement.
- Add a new wiki @ https://docs.tumppi066.fi
	- This wiki is still WIP, and thus has not yet replaced the old wiki.tumppi066.fi

# Bug Fixes
- With the new crash reporting we have fixed a lot of bugs.
